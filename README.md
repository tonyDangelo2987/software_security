# Software Security
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations.

Once finding the security vulnerabilities for Artemis Financial I was able to suppress false positives and make changes in the code base to insure more secure functions/classes/algorithms. It is important to have secure code because it prevents potential data breaches from unknown threats. Having software security greatly increases a company’s confidence level for their clients. It can also improve business and help acquire new clients/customers.

It was a bit challenging for me to start this project because I do not have a lot of experience using Maven. Running and testing for dependencies was new to me. Scanning through the Maven Dependency Report was a bit challenging at first too. All of this was also very helpful to me. Knowing how to do this is very useful in this industry.

To increase layers of security we used Maven to run dependency checks, and we also used ciphers to add encryption to the application. I would use both tools in the future when deciding which mitigation techniques to use.

To make certain that the code and software application were functional and secure I used the tools and techniques previously mentioned. Once this was done, I would run tests and manually check that all the changes made were working properly. After all the tests and checks were made, I would run dependency tests again to ensure non new vulnerabilities were introduced.

The articles in our class’s supporting resources section will be very helpful in the future. These articles were mostly about encryption, hashing, and ciphers which are widely used and trusted. The secure coding assignments were also very helpful; user input validation, creating hashing algorithm functions, and knowing where and when to declare specific types of classes/functions i.e., public/static/private/final.

I would specifically show someone how I created a secure certificate and how I applied it to my own local server. I would also show the hash function I wrote.
